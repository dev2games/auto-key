# auto-key
Very small Auto Typer tool created in C++

Became tired of holding the 'W' key in Elders Scrolls Oblivion in order to train the Sneak skill. So I created this small tool that will spam the 'W' key for me. 

Soon afterwards realized that there's an auto run option in Oblivion. Oh well.

Will continue developing this tool, to support more keys and eventually add a GUI.
